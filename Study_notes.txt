	[-] Team's capacity = Number of stories released/week.
	
[-] Testing

[-] Scrum
	[-] It is a framework that helps in generating value.
	
	[-] Process
		[-] PO arranges the work or user stories for a project in a product backlog.
		[-] Scrum team converts a selected product backlog item into an increment of value during a sprint.
		[-] Team and stakeholders inspect the output and adapt for the next sprint.
		
	[-] Scrum is based on empiricism and lean thinking.
	
	[-] Four events in Sprint enable transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
	
	[-] Scrum Team
		[-] one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers.
		[-] Developers
			[-] They are committed to create an increment of value each sprint.
		[-] Product Owner
			[-] effective Product Backlog management.
			[-] responsible for maximizing the value of a product.
		[-] Scrum Master
			[-] responsible for Scrum team's effectiveness.
			[-] Serves the scrum team, PO, and the organization in numerous ways.
			
	[-] Scrum Events
		Each event in scrum is a chance to inspect and adapt scrum artifacts.
		Events are held at same time and place.
		[-] The Sprint
			[-] Fixed to one-month or less.
			[-] Make sure quality does not decrease during the sprint. 
			[-] Product backlog refinement, scope clarifications and adjustments are done as needed.
			[-] Sprint goal must be met by the end of the sprint.
		[-] Sprint Planning
			[-] Plan that shows list of todo for the sprint.
			[-] Fixed to max of 8 hours or less.
			[-] Sprint backlog = Sprint goal + Sprint's work items + delivery plan.
		[-] Daily Scrum
			[-] 15-minute event.
			[-] Useful to inspect progress toward sprint goal.
			[-] Useful to adjust upcoming work as needed.
		[-] Sprint Review
			[-] Max of four hours/one-month sprint.
			[-] Team shows the demo of their work to stakeholders.
			[-] Useful to inspect sprint's outcome and adapt for future work.
		[-] Sprint Retrospective
			[-] Max of three hours/one-month Sprint.
			[-] Useful to know what went well; what problems were encountered; how issues were solved.
			
	[-] Scrum Artifacts
		[-] They represent value or work.
		[-] Product Backlog
			[-] List of items needed to improve the product.
			[-] Items refinement can be done as more is learned.
			[-] Helps to meet the product goal.
		[-] Sprint Backlog
			[-] It is a plan by and for the developers.
			[-] Developers work to meet the sprint goal.
		[-] Increment
			[-] An usable increment provides value. It has to meet Definition of Done.
